# new joins

welcome to CoronaWhy. 
and thank you. 
in the face of an emergency and an uncertain outcome,
you have stepped forward to share your skills.

One of your most valuable qualifications is 
showing up for the right reasons. 
Our job, 
to show up for medical professionals with a novel product 
is born out of this generosity of talent.

you are a part of an exciting movement in a critical juncture in history. 
As soon as you complete your first task.
 
Your first task is very easy, but the challenge lies in overthinking it.
What you need to do is 
- find a channel in a slack team that engages you
- identify the lead for that channel
- introduce yourself to the lead in a direct message 
along with what brought you to that channel,

Don't overthink it. 
Don't worry if it's the right place 
to start or if you'll do a perfect job. 
And believe me when I say that 
what we need more than anything, is 
for you to dive right in.
